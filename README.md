Robomo
======

Robomo is an open source (MIT license) application created by PatientsLikeMe used to track incoming product requests. Users can request a feature, then stakeholders can have a discussion, upload attachments, track the progress of the feature, etc.

Environment
-----------
Postgres, ruby 1.9.3, rails 3.1.3

Test data
---------
There is a rake task to create some test data.

Logging in
----------
You can use a gmail account to authenticate.

TODO
----

You can choose any of the following features to implement. Your features should be well tested.

* When users reply (post comments) to tickets, they have the option to upload attachments. We'd like a way for users to also annotate those attachments with a description.
* On larger features it can be difficult to see who is responsible for what. A check list of actionable items, including a deadline and person responsible, could solve this problem.

Extra credit
